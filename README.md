# AI TestCase Generator
AI TestCase Generator

##I am assuming you know how to set your own venv and install requirements as per requirements.txt

Using different AI APIs (from huggingface interface) this project enables more than one input interaction with AI, extracting more information in a faster manner. 

For this purpose this application is made explicitly to generate testcases steps from an filled in excel with requirements.


Below you can find a short concept flowchart which I drew for the initial part of the design.
